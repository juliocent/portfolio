Hey there! 

Thank you for coming in, my name is Julio.

I am an aspiring Data Scientist that just finished an immersive Bootcamp at General Assembly. Before starting the course I had developed approximatelly 11 years of experience in diverse industries, such as construction, design and archeology.

The decision to change to Data Science came naturally. In most positions worked, I had a tendency to look at the process, develop insights and implement tools and procedures to improve the product, workflow and reporting. It is my belief that this stems from my first roles and my personality.

At the moment I am having a secon look at the [Bushfires in NSW](/_posts/2020-06-19-Bushfires.markdown) project.
